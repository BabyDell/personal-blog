## Goal

The primary objective of this project was to establish a strong online presence and enhance branding in order to increase client engagement, effectively showcase property listings, and provide valuable educational content. The main challenge we aimed to address was that my client was relatively new to the real estate industry and needed to build credibility within the market. The target audience for this website consisted of local residents in the Coachella Valley, as well as potential homebuyers interested in purchasing property in the region.

## Solution

As part of the research process, I analyzed various personal real estate websites to identify best practices and understand what worked well, as well as what didn't. Specifically, I focused on websites that offered an intuitive user experience, easy navigation, and visually appealing designs. For the technology stack, I chose Next.js due to its fast performance and strong SEO capabilities, which would help attract organic traffic and improve search engine rankings.

## Development

The development tools and technologies used for this project included TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for the frontend frameworks, as well as the Google Maps API for location features, the Spark API for property listings, and Resend for handling the contact form submissions. One of the biggest challenges I faced during the project was implementing the Spark API, as it was my first experience retrieving data from an external server. Learning how to properly use GET requests and extract the correct information required for the listings was difficult, but ultimately, it was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my understanding of API integration.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the final product exceeded the client's expectations, and they were particularly pleased with the professional feel of the website. One area for potential improvement in the future would be the integration of a more advanced filtering system, allowing users to sort listings by various categories. While this feature was not crucial for this client, as their listing inventory was relatively small, it would be highly beneficial for larger real estate agents or agencies with a more extensive catalog. Overall, the project was a success, taking approximately two weeks to complete.
