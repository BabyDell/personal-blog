## What is SEO


SEO stands for search engine optimization which is a set of practices used by programmers to increase search ranks in the browser. There are 200+ factors that go into them. Although most browsers have similar search engines we will be focusing on google's search engine since it is the most used. 


## What are some ways to climb the search engine ranks 


There are 3 main categories that are how your website is ranked in the search engine ranking page. The first one is, creating content users want to see. Second, the bot was able to understand your html. Third is how fast was your content able to load. If you can have a user engaged in your content for long periods of time, have a bot understand your html, and load your content fast it will guarantee higher search ranks. Now we will take a deeper dive into each to get a better understanding of how to achieve and what goes into these factors.


## Is the user Engaged


The first is how likely is a user to click your website on a search engine rankings page. This usually boils down to how relevant the title and description to the search. The higher the better. Secondly after a user clicks that page how likely is it for them to immediately leave the page. This is called a bounce. The lower the bounce rate the better. If a user then decides to stay in the page google will keep track of how long the duration was and how many pages were viewed during the duration. This is referred to as dwell time. 


## Is your html bot friendly


When talking about bot friendly html we refer to metadata in elements, and semantic html elements. An article tag can let the search engine know that this is the main content of the page. In addition to basic semantic html you can add attributes to give it further meaning. For example in an article tag you can add a itemscope and itemtype where you can give the itemtype as a schema article to give it further meta data for your page. It gives easier ways for bots to interpret your page. Outbound links are key as well as they give further information to understand what the page is about. Another technique is to include an alt attribute to image tags since it lets bots know what the image is by describing it. For more complicated elements use aria tags which stands for accessible rich internet applications. 
In the body is not the only place where bots need to understand the html. Head tags include lots of useful metadata to interpret your website. The most important of which is the title and description. Other things it includes it the featured image, author, canonical URL, 


## Does your content load fast


The faster your content loads the less likely a user is to bounce off your site, which will cause your SEO to become better. First way to improve this is by optimizing images. Compressing images to reduce the file size without sacrificing quality. Variety of tools to use but my personal favorite is Squoosh. Implementing lazy loading for images, meaning to load them when they are ready to be displayed. Minimizing HTTP requests, by reducing the number of images, scripts, stylesheets, the browser has to load. Lasly, another way developers can reduce page load times is by caching static files. This means when you visit recent pages they do so more quickly. This technique is used on files that will not change often and can greatly reduce how much data the server needs to transfer.
