## What is an API


API stands for Application Programming Interface and is what programmers use to transmit, receive, and interpret data over a network. 


## A Brief History


API started taking shape in the early 2000s, where they were used commercially as a new method of showcasing products and services online. On top of that it enabled partners and third party resellers to extend their reach. After that facebook launched its API that gave developers access to users' friends, photos, events, and profile info. Amazon then launched S3 or known as Amazon Simple Storage which resources were accessible through an API. Shortly after the Apple iphone and google Android became massive causing a massive investment into applications powered by API. Finally around 2010, developers began using API to connect everyday objects to receive data, content, and other resources. A popular example is Alexa where through the use of API could interact with external services, access data, and perform tasks for users. 


## How Do API’s Work?


A common analogy for an API is it is a waiter at a restaurant. Where the client is the customer and the endpoint where the API is accessing data is the chef. The client asks for a request and the waiter takes that request and goes to the chef to get the request fulfilled. After the request is fulfilled the waiter goes back to the client with a response. 


## Why use an API?


Api can save the burden from making infrastructure and tools that someone else has already solved. For example if you would like to integrate online payments or online reservations APi such as stripe and Open Table would work perfect for you. API also serves as a gate of security, when using an API, you would need authentication or authorization to grant a request. Lastly it is cost efficient as well as building a complex system on your own will be very costly instead of using a third party tool. 


## What does an API Request look like?


All API are not the same and can look different but most follow the same structure. First is identifying the endpoint, the endpoint will be where the url of the API is located. The url will change depending what specific information you want to access.
Determining the HTTP Method. The 4 HTTP methods are GET for retrieving data, POST for sending data to the endpoint, PUT modifying existing data or making it if it doesn’t exist, finally DELETE which is removing data. Third is the Request Header where typically the Content Type, Accept, and auth token is located, The content type tells the server how it should parse the body. Accept header is what type of data the response should be. Then finally an auth token to verify you can make the request. Finally the request body that contains the information.


## Conclusion


The future of web development is exciting and full of possibilities. By staying informed about these trends and continuously learning, web developers can create more powerful, efficient, and user-friendly web experiences.
